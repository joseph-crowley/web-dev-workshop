# WebDevWorkshop with Docker and Django

Welcome to the "Web Development Essentials" workshop! This repository is a companion to the 30-minute introduction to web development workshop, led by Joe Crowley. It's designed to guide you through the basics of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then transition you into creating a "Hello World" project with Django inside a Docker container.

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into several parts, each focusing on a different aspect of web development:

1. **Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: We'll start by creating a simple web page with some styling and interactive elements using JavaScript.
2. **Introduction to Docker**: Here, we'll introduce Docker, a powerful tool that helps to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.
3. **Building with Django**: We'll move our simple web page into a Django application and understand the basics of web applications in Python.
4. **(Bonus) User Authentication**: As a bonus, we will discuss how to add a user authentication system to our Django project.

## Prerequisites
