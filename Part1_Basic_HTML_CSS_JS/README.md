# Part 1: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this section, you will familiarize yourself with the basic building blocks of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll start with a simple HTML file and incrementally add styles and interactivity.

## Files Description

### `pure_html.html`

This is a basic HTML document that structures the web page. It contains a `<head>` section with meta information and a `<body>` that includes a header `<h1>` and a button.

#### What to expect:
- Open this file in your browser, and you will see a plain webpage with a title and a button. There are no styles or interactivity; clicking the button won't do anything at this stage.

### `styled.html`

This file introduces CSS into the mix. Here, you'll find a `<style>` tag added within the `<head>` section that defines the visual appearance of the elements on the page.

#### What to expect:
- When you open this file, you will see a styled webpage. The header has a grey background, the text is centered, and the button has padding and changes the cursor on hover. However, clicking the button still has no effect as we have not added any JavaScript.

### `complete.html`

This final version of the HTML file includes CSS for styling and a JavaScript function for interactivity. The `<style>` tag is still present, and a `<script>` block has been added just before the closing `</body>` tag.

#### What to expect:
- Upon opening this file, the webpage will look the same as `styled.html`. But now, when you click the button, a JavaScript function `showMessage()` is called that displays "Hello, World!" in a designated `<div>`.

## Opening the Files

- **Using a Web Browser:**
   - Right-click on the file you want to open and choose "Open with" from the context menu.
   - Select your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to view the file.
   - Alternatively, you can also drag and drop the file into an open browser window.
